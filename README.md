# rdf-converter-cmdline
Java-based command line software with the aim of converting rdf files from nquads format to json files following datacite schema
(https://github.com/datacite/schema/blob/master/source/json/kernel-4.3/datacite_4.3_schema.json).
It takes as input a folder containing nquads file generated by bmuse (https://github.com/HW-SWeL/BMUSE) 
and assumes that every .nq file is related to one single scraped url.

## Compilation requirements
- git client
- Java 1.8

        [-z]
-h,--help             help
-i,--input <arg>      the input directory that must contain .nq files (REQUIRED)
-o,--output <arg>     the output directory (REQUIRED)
-j,--jsonld          print input data with json-ld format
-v                    verbose

## Example usage

```
./rdf-converter-cmdline-2.3.4.RELEASE.jar -i /tmp/rdf-converter-input/ -o /tmp/rdf-converter-output/ -j
```

The command above performs the following actions
- foreach file stored in nquads format in the given input path (-i) generates a json file following datacite schema in the given output path (-o)
- for each conversion a json-ld file will be printed on standard output corresponding to the input file data
